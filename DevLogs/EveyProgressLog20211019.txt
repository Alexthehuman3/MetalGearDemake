Metal Gear Solid Demake -- Progress Log
Week 1, 13/10/2021-20/10/2021

**Tasks Completed**
- Cameras/Guards detect the player when entering their field of vision
- Field of vision angle, distance, and precision (number of Raycasts) may be adjusted via variables
- Guards, if possessing a weapon, fire upon the player when sighted

**Questions Raised**
- What will further guard behaviours be?
-- How much 'grace period' should they offer the player when first spotted?
-- How far should they chase the player?
-- Will they have a weaker peripheral and a stronger main vision cone?
- Will guards follow the player between areas of a level?
- How will the player kill guards without triggering an alarm? E.g. if they ran up to a guard, get spotted, and kill them quick?
- Should other guards be alerted when one spots the player?
